# KnowHow
This repository focuses on providing education and training on research data management (RDM), giving researchers the '**know-how**' to use RDM best practices within KnowLedger. Included in this discussion is how KnowLedger research data should be managed, both internally in code and documentation, and externally within this project.

An additional activity relative to RDM is creation of data management plans (DMPs), vital to researchers submissions for funding. We hope that in this project the metadata and workflows that are collected can serve as a basis to develop an automated way to create a first draft of a DMP.  To that end, we have also created seperate KnowLedger repository on DMPs, KnowDMP, that you also might be interested in joining.
